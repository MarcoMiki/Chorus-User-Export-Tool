This tool uses the Chorus REST Api to get a list of all the users from a Chorus site and download them as a .csv file. 

It requires a site API key and your site URL. Note that you need an active Chorus subscription to Chorus, including the API module, in order to use this tool. You should generate the API key from the "admin - site" menu which you would only have access to if you have an admin user account on your site.

Note that the file "Procfile" was added in order to deploy this webapp to Heroku, it may not be needed on other platforms.

This app is currently deployed here: [https://chorus-user-export-tool.herokuapp.com/](https://chorus-export-tool.onrender.com)https://chorus-export-tool.onrender.com
